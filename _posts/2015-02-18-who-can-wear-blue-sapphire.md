**Blue sapphire** is called **Indra neelam**. It is the **gem** or **Rathna** prescribed for **Saturn (Shani)**. Not all could wear it. For example, if the **Ascendant (Lagnam)** in your horoscope is **Makaram (Aquarius)** and in the **Shadbalas (six strength of planets)** if Saturn is very weak with small value (for example say 1 or less), it can be presumed that the most favourable graham in the horoscope is weak. In such a case we can prescribe Blue Sapphire for him.

He can buy a Blue Sapphire say 2 carats and can wear in the right middle finger as a ring. The ring can be made in gold or silver. He can wear it on a Tuesday in the kujahora, say by 6.45 am IST. A pooja can be done before wearing. If you are a Hindu you can prefer a Subramanya temple.

**Note**
_Thus only after a careful study of a horoscope, can we prescribe a gem. Now-a-days people wear gem of each dasa. This is not correct._
